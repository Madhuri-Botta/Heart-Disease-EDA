## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Understand the distribution of key health features such as age, resting blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.  
- Explore relationships between features and heart disease presence.  
- Visualize data patterns that could assist in early detection or further model development.

## ✅ Conclusion

This exploratory data analysis revealed key patterns and correlations within the heart disease dataset.  
Variables such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, and exercise-induced factors demonstrated meaningful associations with the presence of heart disease.  
These insights provide a strong foundation for further predictive modeling and highlight the importance of early health indicator monitoring in cardiovascular risk assessment.
